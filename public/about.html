<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I keep it short for now.</p>

<p>Not too long ago I made the career switch to the tech industry. I want to become a great UX/UI designer with a developer background. Having set this goal for myself, I know there is still a lot to learn. So far, though, it feels right and I'm really enjoying it. So feel free to check out my basic portfolio and contact me if you have any questions.</p>

<p>The portfolio project is also a project to learn how to code with HTML. It's nice to start from scratch.</p>
